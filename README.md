# Components

## Description

A React app that uses a sidebar to navigate through different paths of the app. It employs multiple components such as a dropdown, an accordion, buttons, a modal, a table that uses sorting functions, and a counter page.

## Dependencies

- Prop-type
- Tailwind CSS
- Classnames
- React-Icons
- Immer

- Prop-type to validate that only one button variation is true at a time.
- Tailwind CSS framework to add style.
- Classnames for conditionally joining classNames together.
- React Icons to add icons to buttons.
- Immer to directly mutate the state coming from the Reducer function.
